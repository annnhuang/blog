I've been thinking about this for quite some time: negative stuff like regrets (weeping-and-gnashing-of-teeth-level), un-satisfaction, anxiety and uncertainty are actually pretty powerful forces that drive one forward in life. Iâ€™m actually pretty hesitant to immediately break this energy in exchange for more positive stuff like happiness or peace. That is to say- when negative stuff comes ðŸŒŠ, fully embrace them. Sometimes they do well to keep you going forward rather than the positive stuff.

I don't wish for failures but I do treasure them.
