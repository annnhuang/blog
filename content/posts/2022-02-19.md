I’m thrilled to share that my first first-author paper titled “proxemics for human-agent interaction in augmented reality” is accepted for chi (pronounced as “kai”) 2022— highest ranked peer-reviewed journal in the field of human-computer interaction! 🎉 this paper is about how people perceive & interact with virtual human-like avatars in augmented reality. It was wicked fun working with the incredible media informatics team at lmu munich! Currently still working my way through a bajillion to-do’s & deadlines to meet until it’s publication-ready, but thought to take a tiny pause to share the news.

First, mic droppin’ a song🎤😎🔥:

>🥁🥁 ”this is 10% percent luck, 20% skill, 15% concentrated power of will5% percent pleasure, 50% pain, and a 100% reason to remember the name(s)!” (fort minor “remember the name”) 🥁🥁

Ok perhaps I’m overly dramatic about this little achievement 😅, but this news really means a lot to me as this project sort of encapsulates my navigating through life in germany thus far (or just life in general). I suppose my feeling right now is a lot like those actors/actresses at the academy awards ceremony— relieved, and having so much to say, so many people to thank yet totally speechless 🥲.

The process of bringing this project to completion was much like passing through a long tunnel before seeing the light, I.E. The darkness you’d experience when no one believes or yet understands what you’re doing, especially the loneness and faithlessness when you were surrounded with rejections, uncertainties and self-doubts. Finally, until you fully let go of your expectations and simply allow yourself to enjoy science, good things follow.

### On rejections:
It took two rejections and nearly two years to publish this paper. Being rejected is not a pleasant experience, yet as cliché as it sounds, I’ve come to appreciate every rejections/failures because it taught me invaluable lessons. In fact, I’m super thankful that the paper didn’t go through the first two tries, because they were not the right timing and didn’t challenge/push me to my limits. Therefore, always shoot for the stars & never settle for less.

### On not giving up:
Because if you never try, or if you stop trying, you will never know what new heights you could reach or what new experiences you’d gain. And this applies to most things in life. On the importance of being part of a team: humans are made to interact with others in the world; therefore how we realize our role and communicate with others are crucial. It takes a team of visionaries & pragmatists who value the same idea to contribute to the society, not a lone individual. One thing I was pleasantly surprised is how kind people could be e.G., encouraging (with tough love) supervisors and helpful people willing to participate in my experiment. We are all in this together. As strange as it sounds, this project serves as a reminder of not being afraid to put myself out there— life is really “a box of chocolates and you never know what you’re gonna get”! (forrest gump, 1994)

Finally, a small comment working with German colleagues- if there are things I’ve learned from working with the humans of 🇩🇪, it’d be their unwavering commitment, productivity, and their unemotional, no-bullshit attitude to push through things despite hardships. On this note, I must say I’m also a proud 🇹🇼 to be leading this project!!

*Update:*
I also had a good time travelling to Uni Ulm to present my work at the German Pre-CHI conference.
