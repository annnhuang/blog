### Echo Chambers

It was a full week in Taipei. Besides getting my belly full (more like fat üòÖ) every day, I spent the week meeting the people I‚Äôve interacted online in the past months. It was a great time!

> ***‚ÄúEvery person you meet has a lesson to teach, a story to tell and a dream to share.‚Äù- Robin S. Sharma***

I thought I‚Äôd write about how my trip has changed a little bit the way I think about the world and Christianity at large, simply because I‚Äôve noticed this looming tendency in people being increasingly exclusive in their thinking/practices and reluctant to make a change.

Now, I am not in any way against the idea of ‚Äúbeing exclusive‚Äù (see my post on ["Can a community be truly inclusive?"]), because we are all exclusive but that‚Äôs how communities are established i.e., people who share common values flock together; rather, I am trying to expose the holier-than-thou attitude that some (especially Christians) may hold yet not realize it themselves.

*[‚Ä¶]*

I grew up in a Christian family and have been involved in the local churches throughout my life. The ministry in the community emphasizes very much on seeing the vision of God‚Äôs goal and building according to the Scripture, as well as realizing God‚Äôs way (the ‚Äúeconomy of God‚Äù, Ephesians 3:9) of carrying out this plan of building up the Body of Christ through the believers‚Äô growth and functioning in life (1 Corinthians 14:26). I have no issue with it and am very much a beneficiary of the ministry that Watchman Nee and Witness Lee brought forth.

**However, while God is never wrong, people can certainly be.**

> ***‚ÄúNot everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of my Father who is in the heaves. Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, was it not in Your name that we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power? And then I will declare to them: I never knew you. Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness.‚Äù‚Äì Matthew 7:21***

What is seeing a vision all about? What is His heart‚Äôs desire and how could we match Him? I was always taught that I need to go before the Lord and figure it out between me and Him. But admittedly I don‚Äôt always completely understand this in theory and in practice. Then I started to find myself being stuck in an ‚Äúecho chamber-like‚Äù environment, where people are merely repeating the words of the ministry yet not having much reality of what they are believing in. It‚Äôs a bit like saying a certain church is like Pergamos (Rev. 3:12) married to the world yet not realizing that as we claim to be the recovered church in Philadelphia, we could act like that in Laodicea, neither cold nor hot (Rev. 3:14). I don‚Äôt blame anyone, only myself that I lack so many experiences in terms of knowing the Lord (Philippians 3:10).

I think breaking echo chambers firstly requires our awareness of it. Then we need exposure to diverse perspectives. With regards to shepherding people out of it without them being discouraged and shaken to the core? My feeling is that we need people that are mediators (or "channels") who are understanding and willing to make dialogues as well as find common ground through "blending."

### My visit to the True Light Gospel Church (TLGC)

> *‚ÄúAnd if I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, *but do not have love, I am nothing*.‚Äù ‚Äì 1 Corinthians 13:2*

When I visited the TLGC in Taipei, I was touched by their motto which is to ‚Äúwelcome all people regardless of their backgrounds‚Äù. By ‚Äúwelcoming all‚Äù they really mean welcoming everyone, regardless of their race, ethnicity, sexuality, education level, social status, etc. At first, I thought like many churches they only seek to increase the number of the members such that they would grow into a bigger congregation; however, after several interactions I realized they simply wanted to stay true to what the Scripture preaches (Matt. 24:14). They aren't even forcing people to necessarily forsake their church to join them but rather encouraging people to stay true to the purpose that God has shown you. 

So because this church welcomes everyone to their meetings, they are at the forefront of fighting for the underprivledged or marginalized in the society. As a result, several people (including the leading pastors) who identified as LGBTQ+ meet in this church.

### The role of LGBTQ+ people in Christianity

I think it's worth to think about how to engaged the marginalized communities in faith-based groups because given their unique experiences they are well positioned to contribute in an unique way. A community is not an abstract concept of simply coming together because of outward similarities, it is actually an embodiement of shared experiences, hopes and dreams. In other words, we are dealing with people all the time. With people there are all kinds of issues, e.g. did you know that nearly half of the LGBTQ teens said they had thought about suicide during the pandemic as compared with 14 percent of their heterosexual peers [(source: "Why American Teens are So Sad")]? This means if we are serving the young ones in the church yet ignorant of this issue, we could actually be hurting the community. If we don't seek people out, understand and affirm their experiences, what on earth do we think we are doing? In terms of Christian faith, how could we claim that love is the most important thing for building up yet we neglect to take actions to support the marginalized ones?

Some might say, "Yes, but strictly speaking our church is not not welcoming everyone. And our chruch simply focuses on, e.g. "growth and life", which basically solves all problems" Yes, but this statement essentially reflects how set we are in our ways sometimes. We are not even willing to go out of our ways to understand people.

What then could be the role of LGBTQ people in faith-based communities? When I reached out to the members of this church, I realized many of them are warm, sensitive, understanding and empathetic. This is not just because some of them have gone through the coming out experiences (which are often very difficult, because this requires to be fully honest to yoruself) but have found a group that is affirming and supporting their experiences, which in turn, they become the ones that empower others. Isn't this what we need in an increasingly divisive Christian landscape?

Lastly, what I like about the TLGC is that it is not about bringing special attention or care for LGBTQ+ people, but the spirit of welcoming and loving everyone. I like this a lot and hope to infuse this attitude to other Christians.
