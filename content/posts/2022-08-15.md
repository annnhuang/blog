### Echo Chambers

It was a full week in Taipei. Besides getting my belly full (more like fat üòÖ) every day, I spent the week meeting the people I‚Äôve interacted online in the past months. It was a great time!

> ***‚ÄúEvery person you meet has a lesson to teach, a story to tell and a dream to share.‚Äù- Robin S. Sharma***

I thought I‚Äôd write about how my trip has changed a little bit the way I think about the world and Christianity at large, simply because I‚Äôve noticed this looming tendency in people being increasingly exclusive in their thinking/practices and reluctant to make a change.

Now, I am not in any way against the idea of ‚Äúbeing exclusive‚Äù (see my post on ["Can a community be truly inclusive?"]), because we are all exclusive but that‚Äôs how communities are established i.e., people who share common values flock together; rather, I am trying to expose the holier-than-thou attitude that some (especially Christians) may hold yet not realize it themselves.

*[‚Ä¶]*

I grew up in a Christian family and have been involved in the local churches throughout my life. The ministry in the community emphasizes very much on seeing the vision of God‚Äôs goal and building according to the Scripture, as well as realizing God‚Äôs way (the ‚Äúeconomy of God‚Äù, Ephesians 3:9) of carrying out this plan of building up the Body of Christ through the believers‚Äô growth and functioning in life (1 Corinthians 14:26). I have no issue with it and am very much a beneficiary of the ministry that Watchman Nee and Witness Lee brought forth.

**However, while God is never wrong, people can certainly be.**

> ***‚ÄúNot everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of my Father who is in the heaves. Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, was it not in Your name that we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power? And then I will declare to them: I never knew you. Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness.‚Äù‚Äì Matthew 7:21***

What is seeing a vision all about? What is His heart‚Äôs desire and how could we match Him? I was always taught that I need to go before the Lord and figure it out between me and Him. But admittedly I don‚Äôt always completely understand this in theory and in practice. Then I started to find myself being stuck in an ‚Äúecho chamber-like‚Äù environment, where people are merely repeating the words of the ministry yet not having much reality of what they are believing in. It‚Äôs a bit like saying a certain church is like Pergamos (Rev. 3:12) married to the world yet not realizing that as we claim to be the recovered church in Philadelphia, we could act like that in Laodicea, neither cold nor hot (Rev. 3:14). I find that there is just this general fear narrative that exists in the community: "We are all good and satisfied here, out there is evil and bad..." I don‚Äôt blame anyone, only myself that I lack so many experiences in terms of knowing the Lord (Philippians 3:10).

I think breaking echo chambers firstly requires our awareness of it. Then we need exposure to diverse perspectives. How do we shepherd people out of it without them being discouraged and feeling they are shaken to the core? My feeling is that we need people that are mediators (or "channels") who are understanding and willing to make dialogues as well as find common ground through "blending." Imagine two pipes - isn't the water flowing when there is a height difference between the two pipes? We need more flow amongst the Christian believers.

### My visit to the True Light Gospel Church (TLGC)

> ***‚ÄúAnd if I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, *but do not have love, I am nothing*.‚Äù ‚Äì 1 Corinthians 13:2***

When I visited the TLGC in Taipei, I was touched by their motto which is to ‚Äúwelcome all people regardless of their backgrounds‚Äù. By ‚Äúwelcoming all‚Äù they really mean welcoming everyone, regardless of their race, ethnicity, sexuality, education level, social status, etc. At first, I thought like many churches they only seek to increase the number of the members such that they would grow into a bigger congregation; however, after several interactions I realized they simply wanted to stay true to what the Scripture preaches (Matt. 24:14). They aren't even forcing people to necessarily forsake their church to join them but rather encouraging people to stay true to the purpose that God has shown them. 

So because this church welcomes everyone to their meetings, they are leaders in fighting for the underprivileged or marginalized in the society. As a result, there are several people who identified as LGBTQ+ (including the leading pastors) meet in this church.

### The role of LGBTQ+ people in Christianity

I think it's worth to think about how to engage the marginalized communities in faith-based groups because given their unique experiences they are well positioned to contribute in a unique way. A community is not an abstract concept of simply coming together because of outward similarities, it is actually an embodiment of shared experiences, hopes and dreams. In other words, we are dealing with people all the time. And with people there are all kinds of issues. For example, did you know that nearly half of the LGBTQ teens said they had thought about suicide during the pandemic as compared with 14 percent of their heterosexual peers [(source: "Why American Teens are So Sad")]?

This means if we are to serve the young ones in the church yet ignorant of the issues they face, we could in fact be directly hurting the community. If we don't seek people out, understand and affirm their experiences, what on earth do we think we are doing? Now in the context of the Christian faith, how could we claim that love is the most important thing for building up of the church yet we neglect to take actions to support the marginalized ones?

Some might say, "Yes, but strictly speaking our church is not not welcoming everyone. And our church simply focuses on, e.g. "growth and life", which basically solves all problems." Yes, but this statement essentially reflects how set we are in our ways sometimes. We are not even willing to go out of our ways to understand people just as the Lord Jesus did in seeking us out (Romans 10:20; Luke 5:32; John 15:16).

What then could be the role of the marginalized, or specifically the LGBTQ+ individuals, in faith-based communities? Personally I think they bring unique persepctives to the world. For instance, many have gone through the "coming out" experience which they have to describe to families and loved ones about their "non-normative" experiences. Often, this is a very difficult process because they are forced to be completely honest with themselves - facing their own fears and possible judgements from others, meanwhile learning to take responsibility of their decisions. Sometimes I find that this kind of experience shapes some into more sensitive and understanding people. They know what it is to be human and struggle. Don't we need more sensitivity, warmth, and respect in this world? I don't think there is such a thing as "normal" because every individual is different. As such, these ones could be great mediators that create authentic connections between people (which is what the churches today need); furthermore, once they find a group of people that love, support, and affirm them, they are empowered and encouraged to make positive impact on others.

Lastly, what I like about the TLGC is that **it is not about bringing special attention or care for LGBTQ+ people, but the spirit of welcoming and loving everyone.** I like this a lot and hope to infuse this attitude to other Christians.

### What Next?

We should spread this welcoming attitude wherever we go, that there is less hate, misunderstanding and schisms in an increasingly polarized society.
