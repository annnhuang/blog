I don't know about you, but sometimes I'd like to step outside of echo chambers and see what other poeple with seemingly disimliar views have to say.

So today I came across this video.

To be frank, I could kind of understand where he is coming from, even relate to his struggle; however, I neither agree or disagree with the content, and only have one comment about it:

> “Being critical is not the same as critical thinking.”

I don’t know who needs to hear this, but this is a quote that really helps and encourages me through the years, especially those after the [FTTA]:

> “It is not the strength of your faith but the object of your faith that actually saves you. Strong faith in a weak branch is fatally inferior to weak faith in a strong branch. ” ― Timothy Keller, *The Reason for God: Belief in an Age of Skepticism*

Given my natural, stubborn-ass personality which likes to find out the reason behind anything and everything, I don’t think I’ll stop being a hot mess struggling with faith-related things anytime soon…but somehow these types of videos with oppsing views, doubts, skepticism, etc. do not depress me but rather really reminded and encouraged me to go pray and struggle with God Himself.

He seems like a person who puts his whole heart into something and doesn’t settle for less, thus when something seems to be off intuitively, he is shaken to the core, and this is **me, too**, honestly. I admire his spirit of having a critical lens about things; nevertheless, being critical is just not the same as critical thinking. We need more shepherds and teachers to listen and care for these ones.

These days, I just feel that what we need is to learn to listen to one aother. I don't agree being too simplistic in our thinking (see my previous post on [What is Simplicity]), or simply avoiding conflict in the name of keeping oneness. I also don’t agree the opposite extreme where people are making false claims about cult accusations.
