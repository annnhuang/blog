I think simplicity implies trusting. It's a skill to discern the source of incoming information, however shape or form, huge or tiny and learn how to digest them. This sometimes means making a decision to not ingest & psychoanalyze every piece of it, i.e. keep at it despite knowing that the universe— both personal and at large, is inherently defined by randomness and chaos.

Simple-mindedness can be a bit like, e.g. cancel culture, just dismissing things that get into your way, sometimes without a reason. Simplistic-ness is like, idk, naive Christians who think praying could solve all problems, or telling people in the LGBTQ community to go see psychiatrists, and that money can’t buy happiness.

I’d say that unfortunately I often catch myself dwelling in the second & not in the state of being characterized by the first. This is because I think there’s truth to “an unexamined life is not worth living” (but not to an extreme). And cancelling things is how people deal with grief sometimes.

But the real question is— why is this one of the main takeaways from Proverbs?? Discuss.
